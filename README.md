File Used to Start Project (with main method): Main.java

Controls/Key Inputs:
W - Jump
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
I - Invulnerability Mode
N - Skip to Next Level
B - Skip to Boss Level
M - Go to Menu
SPACEBAR - Shoot Fireball
ENTER - Start Game from Menu and Restart Game when Player Wins or Loses
Resource Files: All of the .png files in the "images" folder
Known Bugs: Once in a while, the sprite will go through a block
rather than collide when jumping

Extra Features: 
 - Animation that shows when enemy has been hit by fireball
 - Player can move through the left border of the screen to appear on the right side and vice-versa

Impressions: I liked the fact that this assignment allowed me to 
learn JavaFX given that I only knew how to design graphics in swing. It was nice that we could make any game we want, but it would
have been helpful to have clearer guidelines about the grading
of the project and the complexity of the game (mechanics-wise). Overall, it was a good way to start the semester and practice
software design.
